# Palindrome Checker for a Doubly Linked List

## Problem Description
Given the head of a doubly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

For example:
- Input: 1 ⟷ 2 ⟷ 2 ⟷ 1
- Output: true (it reads the same forward and backward)

- Input: 1 ⟷ 2 ⟷ 3 ⟷ 4
- Output: false (it does not read the same forward and backward)

## Approach
For a doubly linked list, we can take advantage of the bidirectional nature of the list:

1. Handle edge cases:
   - Empty list or list with a single node is trivially a palindrome
   
2. Find the tail of the list by traversing from head to the end.

3. Use two pointers approach:
   - Initialize a 'left' pointer at the head
   - Initialize a 'right' pointer at the tail
   
4. Move the pointers toward each other, comparing values at each step:
   - If at any point the values don't match, return false
   - Continue until the pointers meet or cross each other
   
5. If we complete the traversal without finding any mismatches, return true.

This approach is efficient for doubly linked lists because we can directly move backward from the tail using the previous pointers.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n) - We traverse the list at most twice: once to find the tail and once to compare elements from both ends.
- Space: O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.
