# Remove-Duplicates

## Problem Description
Given an unsorted linked list, remove all duplicate values so that each value appears only once in the list.

## Approach
Hash set to track which values we've seen

## Complexity
- Time: O(n) - n is number of nodes
- Space: O(k) - k is the number of unique values
